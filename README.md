# HeTrue
This repository hosts the HeTrue dataset and accompanying credibility assessment model, as presented in our EMNLP publication. Designed for credibility assessment in Hebrew, the dataset is a product of our collaboration with "The Whistle" from Globes. We encourage the academic community to utilize and provide feedback on these resources.
